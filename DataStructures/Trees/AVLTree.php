 * AVLTree
 *
 * This class is an implementation of a AVL tree. It has as main feature that access,
 * insertion and deletion is O(log n). This is like a BST but it has a slightly difference
 * in nodes: contains a height attribute, used to detect when is needed to rebalance the
 * tree to keep the O(log n).
